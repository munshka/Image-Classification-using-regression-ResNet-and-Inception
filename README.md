# Image-Classification-using-regression-ResNet-and-Inception

This repository contains custom deep learning models for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The models have been designed to provide flexibility and customization options for different image classification tasks.

## Models Overview

### Model 1: Logistic Regression
- **File:** `logistic_regression.py`
- This model uses logistic regression for image classification. It is a simple and linear approach to binary and multiclass classification tasks.

### Model 2: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- **File:** `mlp.py`
- This model is a multi-layer perceptron with customizable hidden layers and activation functions. It's suitable for a wide range of image classification tasks.

### Model 3: ResNet
- **File:** `resnet.py`
- This is a custom implementation of the ResNet (Residual Neural Network) architecture for image classification. You can configure the number of residual blocks, filter sizes, and other parameters.

### Model 4: InceptionNet
- **File:** `inception.py`
- This model is inspired by the Inception architecture, offering flexibility to customize the number of inception-like blocks and their filter sizes for image classification.

### Model 5: Custom InceptionNet
- **File:** `custom_inception.py`
- This is an extended version of the InceptionNet model that allows for more customization. You can specify the number of blocks and their filter configurations to suit your specific image classification needs.



Feel free to contribute, extend, and customize these models for your image classification projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.
